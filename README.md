# Rubiks-Cube-Optimal-Solver
A high-performance optimal Rubik’s Cube solver implemented in Java, designed to compute shortest-possible solution using advanced group-theoretic coordinates, symmetry reduction, and large-scale pruning heuristics. This project reproduces the solving techniques used in SOTA optimal solvers while maintaining a clean object-oriented architecture.
